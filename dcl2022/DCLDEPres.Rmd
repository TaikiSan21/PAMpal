## ABSTRACT

FOSSA: Simple open-source software to simplify DCLDE workflows

There have been significant efforts to improve signal processing methods for the Detection, Classification, and Localization of marine mammals, but the reality of implementing these methods is often a long, convoluted analytical process that impedes adoption and replication. Analyzing passive acoustic data is messy, but it doesnâ€™t need to be that way. FOSSA (Free Open-Source Software for Acoustics) is a series of R packages developed with the goal of making analysis easier by increasing accessibility, reproducibility, and standardization. PAMpal (one of the packages) is designed to work with the output from PAMGuard, providing an end-to-end open source workflow for data analysis. PAMpal vastly simplifies the process of loading PAMGuard output into R. It provides a standardized set of descriptive measures for all clicks, whistles, and burst pulses with a few keystrokes, and users can also add their own custom measures with a single function. Ancillary data (species identity, GPS coordinates, and environmental variables) can be matched to the appropriate detections, each with a single line of code. All data and metadata are saved in a standardized structure; any models designed to work with PAMpal output can be readily adopted by all PAMpal users. Standardized datasets analyzed in PAMpal and saved on open data platforms can provide a common test case for developing and comparing novel analytical methods using real-world examples. Here we present an overview of the basic functionality of PAMpal, as well as a few case studies showcasing how it has helped streamlined a variety of analyses.


## FOSSA Introduction

Shannon's shpeal on our FOSSA thang. Maybe steal her recent graphic

## PAMpal Introduction

PAMpal was created to make it easier to work with data collected using PAMGuard.
The main goals of PAMpal are (1) to develop a standardized approach to processing
data post-PAMGuard that allows you to more readily share and compare results and 
simplifies reproducibility, (2) to create a standardized data structure that allows
us to develop tools that will work for more users without having to rebuild them
every time, and (3) to make this entire process easier to do, especially for users
with less programming experience. We have an extensive tutorial website with more
details on everything covered in this workshop and more:

1. Develop standardized approach to processing acoustic data. Share/compare results and simplify reproducibility
2. Standardized data structure so that tools work for everyone
3. Make it ez pz lemon squeazy

## PAMpal Cont.

GPS? Enviro? Spam slide of examples of things done in one line of code?

1. Avg spec (bolf polts)
2. GPS to detections (MAP?)
3. Environmental variables (ERDDAP?NETCDF?)
4. ICI (Histo)

And more: Link to website, PSAW vids, GitHub

## BANTER

People: Eric Archer, Shannon Rankin

Models are great. Formatting data for models is less great. We're here to help. 

## Banter sell

Other export functions for you

Tracking workshop? Other classifiers? Whatever you want, I do it once then everyone has access to it

## Dive Depth Analysis

People: Annamaria DeAngelis, Annabel Westell

Work requires clips of clicks with potential echoes. Previously required manual Raven nonsense boxing.
PAMpal creates clips for you if you give it wav files, eliminates manual step. And because it was done
in PAMpal we can keep track of the metadata much easier. Creating common outputs - wavs and CSVs

## Dive Depth Sell

PAMpal organizes a lot of information for you

## Beaked Whale Density 

People: Jay Barlow, Jeff Moore, Anne Simonis, Shannon Rankin

Our goal is to make this process reproducible for the future before Jay retires so that we can do this
for all future surveys.

Show folder of code, highlight that first 6 steps or whatever are already covered in basic PAMpal. Maybe this
goes first to give example of how make easy?

Soundspped profile needed, easy to compute bc pampal do enviro

Harp on point fo 20 R scripts, hard to reproduce. PAMpal in a few functions, much easier. 

Condense to a handful of lines of code, m

## BW Sell

Steps 1-6 all done easily in PAMpal. THen if you build a more complicated analysis that works off
that, very simple to reproduce and available to more people.
